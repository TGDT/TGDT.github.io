    <content>
      <p>Gleaming eyes shining in the dark.<br />Visions of lock finer than spun gold filled his mind,<br />replacing theft and debauchery of the blackest kind.<br />The beauty of the princess had hit the mark.</p>
      <p>In his heart a spark,<br />not of anger but of a gentler kind,<br />her laugh the only gold he need find.<br />The princess that turned a dragon into a lark.</p>
      <p>Alas, her beauty belonged among the riches of a palace.<br />So the beast employed his fire,<br />made the noble eyes dim,</p>
      <p>filled his lair with gold of malice,<br />and took the worldâ€™s greatest ire,<br />All to make her love him.</p>
